## 1. Description

## Create a front end application using Angular.  I created a website where the user can view a liquor stores inventory.  The bottles are listed under the distributor's portfolio.

## 6. Wins and Struggles

### Wins
- Getting my front end deployed, connected to my back end and the search component working were my only real wins.  

### Struggles
- My biggest struggle is starting small and coding incrementally.  I have always wanted to "run before I could walk" so this approach is very foreign to me.  Routing links that I was initially going to incorporate proved to be too time consuming if I was going to get this project completed on time.  Also wanted to add a form feature and add more functionality to the search componenet.  I will continue to work on these after our cohort wraps up.
